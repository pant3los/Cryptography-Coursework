# ICSD Cryptography Coursework
This repository contains Python implementations of fundamental cryptographic algorithms developed during my studies at the University of the Aegean (ICSD).

## Contents
* **Rabin Cryptosystem**: A full implementation of the Rabin system where $p, q \equiv 3 \pmod 4$.
* **Chinese Remainder Theorem**: A solver for modular congruence problems.
* **Root Filtering**: A script using `sympy` to find square roots modulo $n$ and filter for specific data patterns.
* **Primitive Roots**: A utility to find generators for a given modulus $n$.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* SymPy library (`pip install sympy`)
